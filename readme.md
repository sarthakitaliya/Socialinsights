## Introduction
**Social Insights** is a simple analytics module designed to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts. The project uses **Langflow** for workflow creation and GPT integration, and **DataStax Astra DB** for database operations. It provides insights into post-performance metrics to help identify trends and optimize content strategies.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
1. Simulate social media engagement data.
2. Store and query data using **DataStax Astra DB**.
3. Use **Langflow** to analyze the data and calculate engagement metrics based upon user input.
4. Leverage GPT integration to generate insights about post-performance.
